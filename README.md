# fair_billing
We can download and extract the zip file -> fair_billing.rar and import the project in eclipse software i.e by clicking on Open Projetcs From File System in eclipse and run the code.
To get the Java code please go through File -> src/fair_billing -> fair_billing.java.
We can change class and package name as per our requirement to run the code. 
We can also copy and paste the same code in our eclpise software and run to get the output. 
Thankyou
